## 42 Main course Project

### Goal: create a library with recoded functions and functions with a described functionality, to be used throughout all future 42 projects and possibly beyond.
### To be updated regularly with additional functions.

# My takeaways:
### Main lesson:  Think of a plan before creating files and creating Makefiles and header files.
### Learned also: Comment functions, especially if there are many, it is easy to loose the overview

### To Improve:   Keep comments short.

## To Do: Continuous integration of new functions used in other projects to libft.
